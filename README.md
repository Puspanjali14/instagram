This is my Instagram clone project, featuring key functionalities like posting, commenting, liking, and a 'Suggested for You' section.
I also implemented JavaScript for interactive elements like the 'Follow' and 'Following' buttons. 
The design includes smooth animations, icons, and a visually engaging user interface, showcasing my expertise in frontend development and web design.
I've focused on designing an engaging and visually appealing experience using icons, animations, and CSS styles.
